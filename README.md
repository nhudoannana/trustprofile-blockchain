# TrustProfile — Blockchain-Based Verifiable Profile & Credential System

> An educational blockchain simulation that demonstrates how digital credentials can be issued, verified, and protected from tampering using SHA-256 hashing, ECDSA digital signatures, Merkle Trees, Proof of Work, and multi-node consensus.

## Overview

TrustProfile models a complete credential lifecycle on a simplified blockchain:

1. An **Issuer** creates a digital credential for a **Holder** (e.g., a university degree).
2. The credential is packaged into a **Transaction** and signed with an **ECDSA (SECP256K1) digital signature**.
3. A **Node** validates the transaction (format, signature, issuer registry, credential status) before accepting it into its **Mempool**.
4. A **Miner** packages valid transactions into a **Block**, computing a **Merkle Root** and solving a **Proof of Work** puzzle.
5. **Three full nodes** independently validate, broadcast, and reach consensus on the blockchain state.
6. A **Verifier** can check any credential by its Credential ID through a 12-step verification process.
7. An **Attack Simulator** demonstrates six classes of tampering and shows exactly which protection layer detects each one.

> **Note:** This is an educational simulation built for an academic blockchain course. It does not connect to any public blockchain, does not use real cryptocurrency, and is not designed for production use.

## Project Objectives

Demonstrate the end-to-end flow of blockchain-based credential management:

```
SHA-256 → Digital Signature → Transaction → Mempool → Merkle Tree
  → Block → Proof of Work → Network → Consensus → Credential Verification → Attack Detection
```

## Implementation Map: P1–P11

| Project Item | Topic | Implementation File(s) | Demo Page | Test File(s) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | SHA-256 Hash | `blockchain/hash.py` | SHA-256 (`1_Hash_Demo.py`) | `test_hash.py` (9 tests) | ✅ Implemented |
| P2 | Block Structure | `blockchain/block.py` | Blockchain Explorer (`6_Explorer.py`) | `test_blockchain.py` (6 tests) | ✅ Implemented |
| P3 | ECDSA Digital Signature | `blockchain/wallet.py` | Wallet & Digital Signature (`2_Wallet.py`) | `test_wallet.py` (4 tests) | ✅ Implemented |
| P4 | Transaction & Mempool | `blockchain/transaction.py`, `blockchain/mempool.py` | Credentials & Transactions (`3_Transaction.py`), Mempool (`4_Mempool.py`) | `test_transaction.py` (6), `test_mempool.py` (5) | ✅ Implemented |
| P5 | Merkle Tree | `blockchain/merkle.py` | Merkle Tree (`5_Merkle.py`) | `test_merkle.py` (6 tests) | ✅ Implemented |
| P6 | Block Header (6 fields) | `blockchain/block.py` | Blockchain Explorer (`6_Explorer.py`) | `test_blockchain.py` (6 tests) | ✅ Implemented |
| P7 | Proof of Work | `blockchain/mining.py` | Proof of Work / Mining (`7_Mining.py`) | `test_mining.py` (5 tests) | ✅ Implemented |
| P8 | P2P Network | `blockchain/node.py` | Network (`8_Network.py`) | `test_node.py` (4 tests) | ✅ Implemented |
| P9 | Mining & Consensus | `blockchain/node.py`, `blockchain/blockchain.py` | Mining & Consensus Flow (`9_Mining_Flow.py`) | `test_consensus.py` (3 tests) | ✅ Implemented |
| P10 | Fork / Chain Split | `blockchain/node.py` (`_handle_block`, `_handle_sync_response`) | Network (`8_Network.py`) | No dedicated test | Partially implemented |
| P11 | Attack Simulator | `pages/11_Attacks.py` | Attack Simulator (`11_Attacks.py`) | No dedicated test (attacks run on UI deep copies) | ✅ Implemented |

**P10 Note:** The system detects a `previous_hash` mismatch and triggers `sync_chain`, which applies the longest-valid-chain rule. It does not implement full fork resolution (e.g., comparing competing chains at equal height, orphan block storage, or chain reorganization). This is a deliberate simplification for educational purposes.

## End-to-End Demo Flow

1. **Create an Issuer wallet** — Open *Wallet & Digital Signature*, enter a name (e.g., "Demo University"), click *Generate Wallet*.
2. **Create and sign a credential transaction** — Open *Mining & Consensus Flow*, select the Issuer wallet, fill in Credential ID / Holder / Title, click *Create → Sign → Submit → Broadcast*.
3. **Broadcast the transaction** — The transaction is automatically broadcast to all online nodes upon submission.
4. **Inspect the mempool** — Open *Network*, expand a node's detail to see pending transactions in its mempool.
5. **Mine a block** — On *Mining & Consensus Flow*, select a miner node, set difficulty, click *Mine Block*.
6. **Confirm consensus** — After mining, the status table shows all three nodes with the same Height and Tip Hash.
7. **Verify the credential** — Open *Verify Credential*, enter the Credential ID, click *Verify*. A 12-step verification report appears.
8. **Attack Simulator** — Open *Attack Simulator*, run any of the six scenarios to see which protection layer detects the tamper.

## Test Coverage

| Test File | Module Tested | Tests |
|---|---|---|
| `test_hash.py` | `blockchain/hash.py` | 9 |
| `test_wallet.py` | `blockchain/wallet.py` | 4 |
| `test_transaction.py` | `blockchain/transaction.py` | 6 |
| `test_mempool.py` | `blockchain/mempool.py` | 5 |
| `test_merkle.py` | `blockchain/merkle.py` | 6 |
| `test_blockchain.py` | `blockchain/block.py`, `blockchain/blockchain.py` | 6 |
| `test_mining.py` | `blockchain/mining.py` | 5 |
| `test_node.py` | `blockchain/node.py` | 4 |
| `test_consensus.py` | End-to-end consensus flow | 3 |
| `test_verify.py` | Credential verification & revocation | 3 |
| **Total** | | **51** |

The Attack Simulator (`pages/11_Attacks.py`) runs six tamper scenarios interactively on deep copies of the blockchain. These are demonstrated through the UI and do not have a separate pytest file.

## Project Limitations

- **In-memory storage.** All blockchain data, wallets, and mempool state reside in memory and are lost when the Streamlit process restarts.
- **Simulated network.** Node communication uses in-process queues; port numbers (5001/5002/5003) are logical labels and no real TCP sockets are opened.
- **No public blockchain.** The project does not connect to any external blockchain or use real cryptocurrency.
- **Simplified consensus.** Fork handling uses a longest-valid-chain replacement strategy triggered by `previous_hash` mismatch. Full fork resolution, orphan block management, and chain reorganization are not implemented.
- **No privacy controls.** Credential data is stored in plaintext in the blockchain. Sensitive personal information should not be placed on a public blockchain without additional privacy mechanisms.
- **Authenticity, not truth.** The blockchain can prove who signed a credential and whether the data has been altered. It cannot independently verify that the original credential content was factually correct.
- **Educational purpose only.** This application is not designed for production use.

## Educational Notice

This repository was developed as a group project for an academic blockchain course. It demonstrates core blockchain mechanisms — hashing, digital signatures, Merkle Trees, Proof of Work, peer-to-peer consensus, and tamper detection — in a controlled simulation environment. It is not intended for production use or real-world credential issuance.

### Lưu ý sau bản sửa PoS (review vòng 3)

- Hash/chữ ký PoS bao gồm `height` để chống sửa bằng chứng ký kép. Block PoS
  tạo bằng phiên bản cũ cần tạo lại; khởi động lại ứng dụng để reset mạng demo trong RAM.
- Khi gọi `is_chain_valid`, `verify_credential` hoặc `verify_selective_claim` cho
  chuỗi có PoS, truyền `pos_registry=network.pos_registry`. Thiếu registry sẽ bị từ chối.
- Benchmark chỉ đo thời gian tạo khối rỗng và số lần thử nonce PoW, chưa đo điện năng.
- Quy tắc sửa code theo Karpathy guidelines được ghi trong [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

### Backend validation (review round 4)

- Block reception, forks, sync and local production validate transaction signatures
  and apply ledger rules in order. Only the original issuer can revoke an active credential.
- Credential IDs are unique for the lifetime of a branch. Reissuing after revocation
  requires a new ID. Conflicting pending transactions cause block production to be
  rejected without changing the chain or deleting the pending transactions.
- Reorganization updates the block pool so the node can receive the next block.
  Sync all selects a valid source and preserves normal validation and mempool handling.
- PoS blocks require zero difficulty and nonce. The mixed demo awards 1 point per PoS
  block and `16 ** difficulty` per PoW block; this is an educational scoring rule,
  not a production hybrid consensus protocol.
